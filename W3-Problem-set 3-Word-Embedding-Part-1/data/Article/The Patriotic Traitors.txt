The Patriotic Traitors: A History of Collaboration in German-Occupied Europe, 1940â€“45 is a 1972 book by David Littlejohn. It is a history of the Europeans who took part in collaborationism with Nazi Germany. Individual chapters are devoted to Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and the Soviet Union.

Littlejohn was later criticized for the book in the work The Kings and the Pawns in which Leonid Rein stated that it was wrong to "attribute all collaboration during World War II to fascist and fascist-like parties".
